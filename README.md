## Usage
To paste a Joseph expression on a photo, run python on test1.py. If you do not give any arguments, then it will use a default photo. If you give a single argument, give a file path from the current folder for the input folder. If you give two arguments, the second one will be the output file to save the result picture to (i.e. joesphied.jpg)
